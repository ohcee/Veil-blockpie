# BlockPie

## This is python program that calls the explorer and gets the current block, block hash, and miner address of the winning block(staking is there too)

### Might have to install pandas
`https://pandas.pydata.org/`

### Get in the file then
### Simply just run:
`python3 blockpie.py`

### Give a few minutes to load up and it should pop a window with the piechart with address and stakes. Shows a percentage of current blocks distribution.
### Its from the current block when you start the program, so give it time at least a day to really see how the blocks are being distributed.
