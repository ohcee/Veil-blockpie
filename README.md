# BlockPie

## This is python program that calls the explorer and gets the current block, block hash, and miner address of the winning block/s. 
## Then checks for missed blocks then updates the addresses and block counts. Then display a colored coded piechart displaying the % of blocks won for each miner that has won a block. 

### Install pandas request and matplotlib
`pip install requests pandas matplotlib`
could be `pip3`

### Get in the file then
### Simply just run:
`python3 blockpie.py`

### Give a few minutes to load up and it should pop a window with the piechart with address ~~and stakes~~. Shows a percentage of current blocks distribution.
### Its from the current block when you start the program, so give it time at least a day or two to really see how the blocks are being distributed.


## TODO:
~~Get algo of winning blocks~~ 
~~Get rid of staking~~
#### Make more pretty
